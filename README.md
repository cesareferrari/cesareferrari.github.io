##How to convert Markdown files to html

To convert a `Markdown` file to `html`, save the `.md` file in the `src` directory.
`cd` into the directory and run the `md_filter.rb` script

```
cd src
./md_filter.rb generate_new_rails_5_app.md
```

This will output an `html` file and save it in the `pages` directory.
